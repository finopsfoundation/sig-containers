# Abstract

The working group for container cost allocation is focused on providing guidance and best practices to practioners around allocating cost of containers. 

A major goal is to provide deliverables that are ready to use but also allows the community to debate about and to contribute and shape further. 

All personas of all maturities are very welcome to contribute by sharing their container stories, asking questions about their day to day challenges with containers so we all learn from each other.

## What problem are we trying to solve?

Addressing some of the problem spaces from sig-containers around container cost-allocation, you can find related topics in the [problem space](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/sig-containers#problem-space) around allocation.

## Why do you think the FinOps Foundation and its practitioners would benefit from this topic?

To avoid duplication, we suggest to read up on this in the [sig-containers mission statement](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/sig-containers#mission-statement)


## Working Group Communication
* Slack Channel: [#wg-container-cost-allocation](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C02BDFZR3V4) 

* We meet weekly on thursday via Zoom, to get an invite reach out in slack channel above
* 05:30p - 06:00p CEST
* 11:30a - 12:00p EST
* 08:30a - 09:00a PDT/PST
* 9:00p - 10:30p IST (Indian Standard Time)
* 01:30a - 02:00a AEST

## Supporting Documentation & Resource
Are there any specific slack conversations, channels, or other publications that you think help support this?

* [2020 whitepaper Calculating Container Costs](https://www.finops.org/projects/calculating-container-costs/)
* [Framework Capabilities Cost Allocation](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cost-allocation/)

## Working Group Output
* A ready to use label schema made from the finops foundation practioners and vendors covering all [personas](https://www.finops.org/framework/personas/) and  [maturity](https://www.finops.org/framework/maturity-model/) level
* A label dictionary with many entries for "inspiration" (and how to decide on them)
* A glossary for the sig-containers terminology and their definition

## Measures of Success
* A label dictionary is accessible to the world and serves as inspiration and orientation to choose the right labels for allocating costs for every maturity level
* A set of label schemas exists in an easy to digest and ready to use format such as yaml
* It is easy to contribute own label schemas and labels to the community

The Output produced is published and supports practitioners in their cost allocation journey in.

## FinOps Framework Alignment
* Labels are mapped to personas
* Labels are rated by maturity
* Output is referenced to the FinOps Foundation projects and capabilities (planned for Q3'22)

## FinOps Foundation Mission Alignment
* creating community for FinOps practitioners
* advancing FinOps practitioners
* defining FinOps open standards and best practices
